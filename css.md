<h1>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h1>

<p><i>CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the <b>color</b> and <b>size</b> of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example <b>turning a single column of text into a layout</b> with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as <b>animation</b>.</i></p>

<p><i>CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.</i></p>
