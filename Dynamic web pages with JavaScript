<h1>JavaScript First Steps</h1>

<h2>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.</h2>

<p>The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:

<ul>
<li>Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called name.</li>
<li>Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming)In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. ''Player 1: Chris".</li>
<li>Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to detect when the button is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</b>provide you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.</p>

Browser APIs are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or do useful complex things. For example:

<ul>
<li><b>The DOM (Document Object Model)</b> API allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS, creating, removing and changing HTML, dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc. Every time you see a popup window appear on a page, or some new content displayed (as we saw above in our simple demo) for example, that's the DOM in action.</li>
<li><b>Geolocation API</b> - geographical information. This is how Google Maps is able to find your location and plot it on a map.</li>
<li><b>The Canvas and WebGL APIs</b> - allow you to create animated 2D and 3D graphics. People are doing some amazing things using these web technologies —see Chrome Experiments and webglsamples.</li>
<li><b></b>Audio and Video APIs like HTMLMediaElement and WebRTC</b> - allow you to do really interesting things with multimedia, such as play audio and video right in a web page, or grab video from your web camera and display it on someone else's computer (try our simple Snapshot demo to get the idea).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Server-side versus client-side code</h2>

<p><i>Client-side</i> code is code that is run on the user's computer — when a web page is viewed, the page's client-side code is downloaded.

<p><i>Server-side</i> code on the other hand is run on the server, then its results are downloaded and displayed in the browser. Examples of popular server-side web languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, ASP.NET and... JavaScript!</p>

<h2>Dynamic versus static code</h2>

<p><i>dynamic<i/> is used to describe both client-side JavaScript, and server-side languages — it refers to the ability to update the display of a web page/app to show different things in different circumstances, generating new content as required.</p>

<p><i>static</i> - A web page with no dynamically updating content is referred to as static — it just shows the same content all the time.</p>
