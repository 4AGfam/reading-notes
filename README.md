# Welcome to My Reading Notes!!

102 reading notes for my class

Hello all,

My name is Antonio George and I am currently enrolled at Code Fellows. I am a 36 years old Army veteran and a single father of two beautiful kids plus my little fur buddy. I currently reside in Orlando, FL and working in the HR field. I am in college to obtain my BS in Computer Science. I became very interested in programming and web development after taking a course on Udemy and Coursera. I love the challenge, the change of pace, the potential for growth, and the career flexibility of being a software/web developer.

## Growth Mindset

### **1. Explain “growth mindset” in your own words.**

To me, the growth mindset is all about humility and resiliency. In order to grow you must be humble. This is simply realizing that you are not perfect, you will fail and that there is always room to grow. This is why resiliency is so important to the growth mindset. I believe that you must have a never quit attitude and a problem solving mentality.

### **2. Include 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset.**

- You have always have what you set your mind too.
- In order to achieve your goals you must get comfortable with being uncomfortable.
- No matter the challenge, be consistant with your focus, determination, and effort.
